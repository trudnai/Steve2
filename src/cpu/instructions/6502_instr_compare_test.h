/**
 TRB - Test and Reset Bits
 
 TRB can be one the more confusing instructions for a couple of reasons.
 
 First, the term reset is used to refer to the clearing of a bit, whereas the term clear had been used consistently before, such as CLC
 which stands for CLear Carry. Second, the effect on the Z flag is determined by a different function than the effect on memory.
 
 TRB has the same effect on the Z flag that a BIT instruction does. Specifically, it is based on whether the result of a bitwise AND of the
 accumulator with the contents of the memory location specified in the operand is zero. Also, like BIT, the accumulator is not affected.
 
 The accumulator determines which bits in the memory location specified in the operand are cleared and which are not affected.
 The bits in the accumulator that are ones are cleared (in memory), and the bits that are zeros (in the accumulator) are not affected (in memory).
 This is the same as saying that the resulting memory contents are the bitwise AND of the memory contents with the complement of the
 accumulator (i.e. the exclusive-or of the accululator with $FF).

/**
 TSB - Test and Set Bits
 
 TSB, like TRB, can be confusing. For one, like TRB, the effect on the Z flag is determined by a different function than the effect on memory.
 
 TSB, like TRB, has the same effect on the Z flag that a BIT instruction does. Specifically, it is based on whether the result of a bitwise AND
 of the accumulator with the contents of the memory location specified in the operand is zero. Also, like BIT (and TRB), the accumulator is not affected.
 
 The accumulator determines which bits in the memory location specified in the operand are set and which are not affected. The bits in the
 accumulator that are ones are set to one (in memory), and the bits that are zeros (in the accumulator) are not affected (in memory).
 This is the same as saying that the resulting memory contents are the bitwise OR of the memory contents with the accumulator.
